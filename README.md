# Fallstack 2025

## Hello there! 👋

Welcome to the Fall Stack event's GitHub repository. Here you'll find everything you need to contribute with your amazing code and ideas!

This is a Núcleo de Estudantes de Informática project, made by students from ISEP.

## Description

Fall Stack is a tech event that happens every year with the intention of presenting tech companies to students that are looking for an internship.

This is also a great place for networking and really getting to know the market.

The event takes place in ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto) in the 28th and 29th of November.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`
3. Set up the environment variables `cp .env.example .env`
   - Provide Supabase envs: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (service role).
   - In Supabase Storage, create two buckets:
     - `avatars` (public)
     - `cvs` (private)
   - If migrating from the previous Firebase storage, old uploads continue to work; new uploads use Supabase.
   - For immediate signup sessions (required by the existing signup flow), disable email confirmation in your Supabase Auth settings or adjust the flow to wait for confirmation.
4. Run `pnpm prisma db push` (or `pnpm generate` then `prisma migrate`) to sync schema.
5. Generate the Prisma Client with `pnpm generate`

## Running locally

To start the local server use

```bash
pnpm dev
```

> 💡 Use our docker compose targets to run the database stack you need for local work.
>
> - `docker compose up -d db` starts a plain Postgres instance on port `5432` for Prisma-only development.
> - `docker compose --profile supabase up -d` starts the full Supabase stack (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Studio, etc.).
>   - Supabase Postgres is exported on `54322`, the API gateway on `54321`, Studio on `54323`, and the local SMTP inbox on `54324`.
>   - When that profile is running, point `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres`.
>   - Stop everything with `docker compose --profile supabase down` (add `-v` to drop local volumes).

## Sync database schema

To apply your Prisma schema changes, sync the database schema with the following command:

```bash
pnpm prisma db push
```

## Seeding

To run the seeding script run

```bash
pnpm seed
```

## Supabase Setup

- Create a Supabase project and set the following env vars from your project settings:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (service role)
- Create storage buckets:
  - `avatars` (public)
  - `cvs` (private)
- Disable email confirmation for immediate sign-in after signup, or adjust the flow.

### Self-hosted Supabase (Docker profile)

For offline/local testing you can rely on the bundled Supabase profile instead of a hosted project:

1. Duplicate `.env.example` into `.env`. The default values already point to the local gateway (`http://127.0.0.1:54321`) and contain anon/service role tokens that match the docker profile.
2. Start the stack with `docker compose --profile supabase up -d`. The compose output shows each service (`supabase-gateway`, `supabase-auth`, `supabase-storage`, etc.).
3. Make sure Prisma connects to the Supabase Postgres instance (`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres`) and run `pnpm prisma db push` to create/update schemas.
4. Visit:
   - Supabase Studio → http://127.0.0.1:54323 (manage tables, storage buckets, auth users)
   - Local SMTP inbox → http://127.0.0.1:54324 (emails generated by GoTrue, useful if you re-enable confirmations)
5. Stop or clean up with `docker compose --profile supabase down` (append `-v` to remove data volumes).

When you switch back to a hosted Supabase project, just override the Supabase env vars in `.env` with the values from your project dashboard.

## Wipe DB

To wipe the database run

```bash
pnpm wipe
```
